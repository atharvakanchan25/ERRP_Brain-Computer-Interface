# ðŸ§  CognitiLearn: Brain-Computer Interface for Cognitive Enhancement

CognitiLearn is an Android-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) application designed to enhance cognitive performance through EEG-based brain games. The app leverages Error-Related Potentials (ErrPs), such as Error-Related Negativity (ERN) and Error Positivity (Pe), to detect cognitive errors in real time and adapt training exercises accordingly.
